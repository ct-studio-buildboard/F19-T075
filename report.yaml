product_hmw: How might we help working millennial parents manage their household and planning events and life celebrations?
product_narrative: |
  With more than 1M millennial women becoming mothers each year, the space of Parent-tech is booming. 
  Our challenge is to find out a digital solution to help them with parenting-related pain points and make an impact on future parenthood ways.
  Over the semester we have come up with several ideas and eventually we decide to go with "ParentLINK" - a product that helps millennial parents find couple friends that are similar to them because we found in our research that loneliness is a major issue for them.
